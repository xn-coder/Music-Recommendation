# Music-Recommendation

Welcome to the Music Recommendation System project! This project aims to provide personalized music recommendations to users based on their listening history and preferences. Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques and a rich dataset of songs, we strive to enhance the music listening experience by suggesting tracks that users are likely to enjoy.

## About

The Music Recommendation System leverages a dataset containing information about songs, including artist names, song titles, and lyrics. Through text preprocessing and feature extraction, the system analyzes the content and context of each song to understand its characteristics and themes. By applying machine learning algorithms, it identifies patterns and similarities between songs, enabling it to recommend music that matches the user's taste.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations:** Tailored music suggestions based on user preferences and listening history.
- **Large Dataset:** A comprehensive collection of songs across various genres and artists.
- **Text Analysis:** Advanced text processing techniques to analyze song lyrics and identify themes.
- **User Interface:** A simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with the recommendation system.
